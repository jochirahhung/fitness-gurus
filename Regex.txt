Conditional Regular Expressions

If: 
	- True
		Regex engine will attempt to match the "then" part.

	- False 
		Regex engine will skip over if and go to else.
Then: 
	- Happens after "if" statement is matched, "then" is basically an event that accurs 
		if the "if" statement is met.

Else: 
	- This accurs if the regex engine passes over the "if" statement. 
		Regex engine passes over if the statement is false.

Syntax: 
	- (?(if)then|else) or (?ifthen)
